## **How I Used Cloudinary in My AOT Website**

I used **Cloudinary** for the **image and video management** aspect of my **Attack on Titan (AOT) fan website**. Below are some of the ways Cloudinary helped enhance my AOT site:

---

### 1. **Image Hosting and Delivery**:
- **High-quality AOT artwork**: Cloudinary allowed me to upload high-resolution images of AOT characters, scenes, and posters. These images are served via Cloudinary’s CDN, ensuring fast loading times for users across the world.
- **Responsive Images**: Using Cloudinary's transformation features, I serve **different image sizes** depending on the user’s device. This helps ensure that the AOT images look great on both mobile and desktop without wasting bandwidth.

### 2. **Image Optimization**:
- I used Cloudinary to **automatically optimize images** for the web. This helped reduce the size of heavy artwork images without sacrificing quality, improving **page load times** on the website.
- For example, I used Cloudinary to serve **WebP** images, a format that reduces image sizes significantly while maintaining quality, making the site more efficient.

### 3. **Video Hosting**:
- For **AOT video content** (such as trailers, fan edits, or episode clips), I used Cloudinary’s video hosting. Cloudinary automatically converts videos to different formats (like **MP4**), ensuring that they are playable on all devices.
- Additionally, videos are optimized for performance and are streamed from Cloudinary’s CDN, ensuring smooth playback for visitors.

### 4. **Image Transformations**:
- Cloudinary’s transformation tools allowed me to perform **dynamic transformations** to AOT images without needing to manually resize or edit them. For example:
   - Cropping images of AOT characters to fit into specific section layouts.
   - Adding **watermarks** on fan art images to protect creators' work.
   - Adjusting the **aspect ratio** of images based on page layout, ensuring consistency across different sections of the site.

### 5. **Efficient Management**:
- Cloudinary’s media management tools made it easy to **organize** the large collection of AOT-related media. I tagged images and videos, categorized them by season or character, and used **Cloudinary’s search** functionality to quickly find the media I needed.

## **Adding Cloudinary to My Website**:

Here’s how I integrated Cloudinary into my AOT website:

### 1. **Sign Up for Cloudinary**:
   - Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for a free account.
   - Once registered, you’ll get an API key and cloud name, which are needed to interact with the Cloudinary API.

### 2. **Installing Cloudinary SDK**:
   I used the **Cloudinary SDK** for React, which was installed using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install cloudinary-react
   ```

   In my **React components**, I used the SDK to display images:

   ```jsx
   import { Image } from 'cloudinary-react';

   const AOTImage = ({ publicId, alt }) => {
     return (
       <Image
         cloudName="your-cloud-name"
         publicId={publicId}
         width="500"
         crop="scale"
         alt={alt}
       />
     );
   };
   ```

   In the above code, `publicId` refers to the unique identifier of an image on Cloudinary, and I’ve added parameters to resize the image for optimal display.

### 3. **Uploading Media to Cloudinary**:
   - For images like **AOT banners** or **posters**, I simply uploaded them to Cloudinary via the **Cloudinary Dashboard**.
   - Alternatively, I used **Cloudinary’s API** to upload images directly from the website during user interactions (like **user-submitted fan art**).

### 4. **Using Transformations**:
   For example, to resize an AOT character image dynamically, I added transformation parameters to the image URL:

   ```jsx
   <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud-name/image/upload/w_500,h_750,c_fill/character_image.jpg" alt="AOT Character" />
   ```

   In this case, `w_500,h_750,c_fill` ensures the image is resized to 500px wide and 750px high, and `c_fill` makes sure the image fills the space appropriately.
